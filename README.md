# VirtualBoxCLI completions for fish

Provide completions for [virtualbox cli](https://www.virtualbox.org) in [fish](https://fishshell.com).

## Installation

Install with [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) :

```fish
fisher add jduchateau/fish-virtualbox-completions
```

Otherwise, you could merge the files in your fish directory (typically in `~/.config/fish/`).

## Note

Not everything is completed perfectly.
The main commands are working, but this is not exaustive at the moment.
If you want to help, I will be happy to merge your pull request.
